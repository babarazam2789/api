Create the program using Microsoft cognitive API for IoT

1)	First, we need to create a Text Analytics service resource. The cognitive service in the container image will use this to report billing data too.

2)	Select a resource group, and now we’ll fill in a name. Pick a pricing tier. We also need to agree to the responsible AI notice. Let’s create it.

3)	In the Text Analytics service. To enable the container to send billing data to it, we need a couple of things. We need the API key from here and also the service endpoint.

4)	Let’s create a container. We’ll do that using a Power Shell script in the Azure Cloud Shell. We can also use the Azure CLI for this. The scripts will create a new Azure App Service web app for containers, and it will create a container in there with this image. This is a cognitive service image for the Text Analytics health feature. We’ve also filled in the key and endpoint for the service in Azure.

There it goes and we can find its URL in the web app for containers.

5)	Let’s take a look. The health feature of the Text Analytics Service has a demo feature. Just add /demo to access it. Now, this feature analyzes text for health-related phrases like illness, treatment, and medication. Let’s try with a sentence. It identified these phrases with their meanings. It used the Cognitive Service that runs in a container, in the Web App for Containers.
